## Unit 1 | Assignment - KickStart My Chart
## Background

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success.

## Analysis Conducted

* I analyzed the data of four thousand past Kickstarter projects in an attempt to uncover some market trends.

* Using charts, conditional formatting, pivot tables, and other excel features i was able to mold the data into a format which was easier to analyze at first glance. 

I answered the questions below in the 'excel_analytics_observations' word doc.

1. What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?
2. What are some of the limitations of this dataset?
3. What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?
